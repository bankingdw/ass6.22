1.Why MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming?

*Pig is an application which runs that the top of theMapReduce and abstract java mapreduce jobs away from developers.
 *Java is a first-class language in Hadoop and always give the developer with more options.
 *However , Pig is written in Java and allows for delvelopers to write user defined functions in java that leverages java libraries.
 *So, we call Pig a second-class language in MapReduce.
 
2.. What are advantages of Pig over MapReduce?

PIG:

*When we write the same code in Pig, the number of lines of code will drastically decreased.
*Another thing is we need not import any libraries.
*It is very easy for someone without the knowledge of java and with little SQL knowledge.

MAPREDUCE:

 *Knowledge in java programming is required.
 *When we write a MapReduce program for a problem, it may takes many lines of code and also we should import some or more libraries to
 begin the MapReduce job.
 *Also we need to write Mapper and Reducer classes along with the Driver class.
 *Then we need to compile and execute the program.


3.What is Pig engine and what is its importance?

Pig Engine:
      *Apache Pig has a component known as Pig Engine which accepts the Pig Latin scripts and converts those scripts into 
MapReduce jobs.

Pig Engine importance: 
      *It acts as an interpreter between the Pig Latin script and MapReduce jobs.
      *It creates environment to execute pig scripts into series of mapreduce jobs in parallel manner.

4.What are the modes of Pig execution?

*There are two modes of Pig execution: 
             1. Local Mode: In this mode, you run the Pig to access to a single machine, where 
all the files are stored in local file system.
             2. MapReduce Mode: In this mode, you run the Pig to access to a Hadoop Cluster and HDFS installation.

5.What is Grunt Shell in Pig?

*The Grunt shell of Apache Pig is mainly used to write Pig latin scripts.

6. What are the features of Pig Latin language?

Features of Pig Lation Language:

*It provides many operators to peform operations such as join, sort, filter, etc.
*It is similar to SQL and it is easy to write Pig script if you have good knowledge in SQL.
*The tasks in Apache Pig optimize their execution automatically.
*It provides the facility to create user-defined functions in other programming languages such as Java, and invoke
or embed them in pig scripts.

7. Is Pig Latin commands case sensitive?

*The names of relations and fields are case sensitive.
*The names of the Pig latin functions are also case sensitive.
*The names of paramaters and all other keywords are case insensitive.

8. What is a data flow language?

*In computer programming, dataflow programming is a programming paradigm that models a program as a directed
graph of the data flowing between operations thus implementing dataflow principle and architecture.
